H5P Text
========

The H5P.Text library is a simple wrapper for the native text support, so it may be used as a submodule within other libraries.

It should not be used to add normal text support to your library. It is only necessary in cases where multiple optional sublibraries may be inserted within a larger context. For examples of use, see H5P.CoursePresentation and H5P.InteractiveVideo.
